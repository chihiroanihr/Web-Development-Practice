--> You need to create mailchimp account
--> Audience > Sign Up Forms > Form Builder (select)
--> Copy Sign Up Form URL and open in new tab
--> Right-click on the new tab "Sign Up Form" page > View page source
--> Scroll way down the page until you get to the <form> section
--> There are 4 parts to copy and save for later reference...
    The URL inside of the action="".
    The value in the input field with name="u".
    The value in the input field with name="id".
    In the input field sections for Email, First Name, Last Name â€“ take note of the for="" in each of them. For me they are named MERGE0, MERGE1, and MERGE2 respectively. 
    We will reference these later in our form to map our own fields with these Mailchimp fields.
